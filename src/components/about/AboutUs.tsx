        Our Story
      </p>
      <p className="text-center text-gray-600">
        We began as a church plant meeting in places like granges and hotels.
        After a few years of renting places, our small group, along with our
        sending church, decided to purchase a more permanent location on South
        Gold Street. The building was most recently used as a chiropractor
        office and was not much of a church building. The bathrooms were located
        in the sanctuary. The carpet was old and worn. The building was rather
        musty - but it was ours, all 5 parking spots and the 1,600 square foot
        building (You're right, it wasn't much). Looking back on those days it
        was nothing short of a miracle that people came to church and stuck
        around. We praise the Lord as He is the one who builds His church - in
        spite of the obstacles.

        In 2010, Pastor Tim led the church to charter and also remodel the
        building to make every square foot count. As the church grew, we went to
        two morning services and filled the building up again. It became obvious
        that it was time to relocate and God opened the door. In 2014, we moved
        to our current location and have been remodeling and building ever
        since. It took 3 1/2 years, but we built our current sanctuary debt free
        and went back to one morning worship service the first Sunday of 2018.

        In January 2022, God led Pastor Tim to a new ministry opportunity to
        serve at a children's home in Florida. During this time, the church
        called Assistant Pastor Andrew Fix to serve as the next lead pastor of
        NBBC. Pastor Fix and his family faithfully ministered to the
        congregation until November 2024. When it was announced that Pastor Fix
        would be moving to Texas, the church extended a call to Pastor Tim to
        return as lead pastor. He is set to resume his role in June 2025, and we
        eagerly anticipate all that God has in store for the future of NBBC! In
        the meantime, the church is being encouraged by a team of dedicated
        local pastors who are partnering with Pastor Tim and the leaders at NBBC
        to faithfully preach and serve, helping to ensure a smooth and prayerful
        transition.
