          The Bible
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-900 text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
          We believe that the Holy Bible was written by men supernaturally
          inspired; that it has truth without any admixture of error for its
          matter; and therefore is, and shall remain to the end of the age,
          preserved and the only complete and final revelation of the will of
          God to man. We believe the Masoretic Text of the Old Testament and the
          Textus Receptus of the New Testamentâ€”by their traditional acceptance
          and preservation by New Testament churches, to be the inerrant,
          infallible Word of God. For reasons of unity within the church and
          textual reliability we choose to use the King James version of the
          Bible since it is based solely on these texts.

          substance, yet manifests Himself to man in three persons: the Father,
          the Son, and the Holy Spirit. All three equal in every divine
          perfection, and executing distinct but harmonious offices in the great
          work of redemption.

          Jesus Christ
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-900 text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
          We believe Jesus Christ to be the one and only Saviour of mankind. We
          believe Jesus Christ to be eternally God and to possess all the
          attributes of Deity. We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ was virgin
          born, that He was God incarnate, and that the purposes of the
          incarnation were to reveal God, to redeem men, and to rule over God's
          kingdom. We believe Jesus Christ never relinquished any attributes of
          His Deity, but merely veiled them. We believe He lived a perfect,
          sinless life, at the end of which He was offered for all mankind as a
          substitutionary sacrifice for man's sin. This sacrifice was a just
          payment to God for the forgiveness of sin. It was activated by His
          death through the shedding of His blood on the Cross and was accepted
          by God upon His resurrection. We believe He ascended into Heaven after
          His resurrection to be seated at the right hand of the Father, waiting
          for the time of receiving all genuine believers at the Rapture, and
          returning seven years later to earth to rule and reign as King for
          1,000 years.

          convicts of sin, of judgment, and of righteousness; that He bears
          witness to the Truth of the Gospel in preaching and testimony; that He
          is the agent in the New Birth; that He seals, endues, guides, teaches,
          witnesses, sanctifies, and helps the believer.

          We believe all men were born with an inherited sin nature received
          from our common ancestor, Adam. We believe that because of his nature,
          man is a sinner by choice, and he is totally incapable of reforming
          himself or ceasing from his sin by his own power. We believe the only
          hope of deliverance for man is a total change of mind concerning his
          sinful condition and inability to change it, and a turning to Jesus
          Christ as the only Saviour. We believe that only through the
          substitutionary sacrifice of Christ on the Cross can a man be
          delivered from his sin. We believe that all those who reject Jesus
          Christ as their Saviour are already condemned to an eternity in the
          Lake of Fire.

          was created directly in God's own image and after His own likeness;
          that man's creation was not a matter of evolution or evolutionary
          change of species, or development through interminable periods of time
          from lower to higher forms; that all animal and vegetable life was
          made directly and God's established law was that they should bring
          forth only "after their kind".

          We believe the church began with the calling out of the twelve
          apostles by Jesus Christ and was empowered on the day of Pentecost. We
          believe the local church is composed of members who have been saved
          and baptized according to the command of Christ, and have voluntarily
          united together for the purposes of worship, fellowship, service, and
          the Lord's Table. We believe all true believers, regardless of their
          church affiliation, will be taken up at the Rapture, just prior to the
          Tribulation.
